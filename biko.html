    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups glutinous rice aka sticky rice or malagkit</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 cups brown sugar</li>
        <li>4 cups coconut milk</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Combine the sticky rice and water in a rice cooker and cook until the rice is ready (we intentionally combined lesser amount of water than the usual so that the rice will not be fully cooked)</li>
        <li>While the rice is cooking, combine the coconut milk with brown sugar and salt in a separate pot and cook in low heat until the texture becomes thick. Stir constantly.</li>   
        <li>Once the rice is cooked and the coconut milk-sugar mixture is thick enough, add the cooked rice in the coconut milk and sugar mixture then mix well. Continue cooking until all the liquid evaporates (but do not overcook).</li>
        <li>Scoop the cooked biko and place it in a serving plate then flatten the surface.</li>   
        <li>Enjoy!</li>

    </ul>
