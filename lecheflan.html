    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 pieces eggs</li>
        <li>1 can condensed milk (14 oz)</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh milk or evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Using all the eggs, separate the yolk from the egg white (only egg yolks will be used).</li>
        <li>Place the egg yolks in a big bowl then beat them using a fork or an egg beater</li>
        <li>Add the condensed milk and mix thoroughly</li>
        <li>Pour-in the fresh milk and Vanilla. Mix well</li>
        <li>Put the mold (llanera) on top of the stove and heat using low fire</li>
        <li>Put-in the granulated sugar on the mold and mix thoroughly until the solid sugar turns into liquid (caramel) having a light brown color. Note: Sometimes it is hard to find a Llanera (Traditional flan mold) depending on your location. I find it more convenient to use individual Round Pans in making leche flan.</li>
        <li>Spread the caramel (liquid sugar) evenly on the flat side of the mold</li>
        <li>Wait for 5 minutes then pour the egg yolk and milk mixture on the mold</li>
        <li>Cover the top of the mold using an Aluminum foil</li>
        <li>Steam the mold with egg and milk mixture for 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>After steaming, let the temperature cool down then refrigerate</li>
        <li>Serve for dessert. Share and Enjoy!</li>
    </ul>
