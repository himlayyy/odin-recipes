    <p>Yema is a candy made of egg yolk, milk, and sugar. Its name is from the Spanish word yema which means “egg yolk”. It is believed that yema originated from early Spanish construction materials when egg whites mixed with quicklime and eggshells were used as a type of mortar to hold stone walls together. The discarded egg yolks were reused to make various dishes like leche flan and yema.</p>
    <p>Yemas were originally made with only egg yolks and sugar, heated and stirred until the consistency is thick. Traditionally, it is covered in colorful plastic wrap and shaped into pyramid. Modern variations include chopped nuts and sometimes shaped into a ball with sugar sprinkles. You can find it in specialty or pasalubong stores or being sold in the street usually by bus vendors. Yema has now evolved from being a candy to yema spreads and yema cake.</p>
